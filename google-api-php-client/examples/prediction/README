Getting Started:

     register your application.

     - From the "Services" tab, activate access to "Prediction API".
     - Click on "API Access" in the left column
     - Click the button labeled "Create an OAuth2 client ID"
     - Give your application a name and click "Next"
     - Select "Web Application" as the "Application type"
     - click "Create client ID"
     - click "Edit..." for your new client ID
     - Under the callback URL, enter the location of your PHP application.

  2) Update index.php with the redirect uri, client ID, client secret, and 
     API key you obtained in step 1.

     - Update 'insert_your_oauth2_client_id' with your oauth2 client id.
     - Update 'insert_your_oauth2_client_secret' with your oauth2 client secret.
     - Update 'insert_your_oauth2_redirect_uri' with the fully qualified 
       redirect URI.

    The API key is listed under "Simple API Access" section at the bottom
